on photographic data obtained using the Oschin Schmidt Telescope on 
Palomar Mountain and the UK Schmidt Telescope. The plates were 
processed into the present compressed digital form with the 
permission of these institutions.

their own film or digital images of objects in the night sky.  All
images are freely available for non-commercial use in electronic 
form, but may not be printed on paper without written permission.
