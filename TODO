## New KStars TODO list:  May 2013
## Announce interest in working on these on kstars-devel@kde.org
## suggest new items on the same list or at http://bugs.kde.org

0. Release Critical:
--------------------

- Massimiliano's bug on Hipparcos epoch not being J2000.0

- Tune-up Samikshan's work for release

- Database problems

- Magnitudes in Steinicke and regular NGC/IC catalog (see BUG: 302118)

- KStars goes back to focusing North when centering on an object which
   is not enabled for display. (eg: Disable comets in the settings and
   find and center on a comet from the find dialog). [BUG: 266774]

- Check if SDSS feature is working, because it always seems to report
   out-of-range even if in the footprint, according to BUG: 220857

1. Bug reports to be resolved:
------------------------------

- When right-clicking on the Sky Map, objectNearest() should bring up
  the most significant object that is nearby. For example, right
  clicking on Jupiter at sufficiently low zoom should bring up
  Jupiter rather than one of the Galilean satellites. [BUG: 210714]

2. Other required fixes:
------------------------

- Massimiliano's bug on the Mailing List -- Hipparcos epoch is not
   J2000.0

- M 17 position is off

- Combine various telescope info into the userDB

- Polish observation list feature:
      + Provide some help on how to use it efficiently
      + More intuitive names for "Execute". Better keybindings.
      + Polish and fix "Execute" with logging capabilities.

- Distribute latest Steinicke NGC/IC catalog via GHNS.

3. Wishlist stuff
-----------------

- Make DSS source user-configurable

- Move storage of DSS and other images to the user database

- Improved observation logging support using the userDB

- JMoons tool: show dates rather than day offset; show position of moons at t0

4. Larger New Feature Ideas
---------------------------

- Move to MarbleWidget [?] for Geographic Location selection

- Almanac tool (sun events, moon events, planet events, etc)

- Support multiple DSS sources

- SIMBAD / VizieR queries from Find Dialog and import result into
   KStars' catalog DB.

- Solar system viewer: more interactive; independent clock; include minor bodies

- Countour lines for nebulae

- Indicate binarity/variability of stars on map?

- Better rendering of comets and asteroids

- Improve the Star Hopper and give it a good interface. Also make it
   DBus accessible.

- More Milky Way isophotes

5. Large projects
-----------------

- Add more planet satellites

- Add Earth satellites (man-made)

- Update moon position code to Meeus 1998.

6. Ever-present needs
---------------------

- Translations

- Improve documentation

- More AstroInfo articles

- More internet links
