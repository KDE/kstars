            The Ekos Alignment Module enables highly accurate GOTOs and can measure and correct polar alignment errors. This is possible thanks to third-party plate-solving technology. The main plate-solving software used is the StellarSolver package, which itself makes use of the offline (and online) astrometry.net, ASTAP and Watney solvers.  Ekos begins by capturing an image of a star field, feeding that image to the chosen solver (e.g. see <ulink url="https://astrometry.net">astrometry.net</ulink>, <ulink url="https://github.com/rlancaste/stellarsolver">StellarSolver</ulink> or <ulink url="https://www.hnsky.org/astap">ASTAP</ulink>), and gets in return the central coordinates (RA, DEC), scale, and orientation of the image. The solver essentially performs pattern recognition against a catalog of millions of stars. Once the coordinates are determined, the true pointing of the telescope is known.
        </para>
        <para>
            Often, there is a discrepancy between where the telescope thinks it is looking at and where it is truly pointing. The magnitude of this discrepancy can range from a few arcminutes to a couple of degrees. Ekos can correct the discrepancy by syncing to the new coordinates, and then slewing the mount to the desired target originally requested.
        </para>
        <para>
            Ekos also provides a Polar Alignment Assistant Tool to correct polar alignment errors. It takes three images, slewing between the images, and calculates the offset between the mount axis and polar axis. It feeds back to the user the altitude and azimuth adjustments needed to align these axes. These images are typically taken near the celestial pole (close to Polaris for Northern Hemisphere) but can work well taken from anywhere, usually starting near the meridian and slewing either East or West.
        </para>
        <para>
            At a minimum, you need a CCD/Webcam and a telescope that supports Slew &amp; Sync commands. Most popular commercial telescope nowadays support such commands.

        To use the solvers, you must first configure the StellarSolver options. The above page is displayed when clicking on the <guilabel>Options</guilabel> button on the lower right of the Align page, then selecting the <guilabel>StellarSolver Options</guilabel> tab. Start with the <guilabel>Builtin method for solver</guilabel> <guilabel>Source Extraction method</guilabel> so that each solver uses its preferred star-extraction code. For <guilabel>Solving Method</guilabel> we recommend choosing <guilabel>Internal Solver</guilabel> to use StellarSolver's copy of the Astrometry.net code, or choose <guilabel>Local ASTAP</guilabel> if you prefer that. The online astrometry solver is accurate, but can take a long time to solve because of all the data transfer required. For <guilabel>Options Profile</guilabel>, start with the <guilabel>1-Default</guilabel> profile.

      <para>
        There are two other minor options. <guilabel>WCS</guilabel> or  World-Coordinate-System is a system for embedding equatorial coordinate information within the image. When you view a solved image, you can hover it and view the coordinate for each pixel. You can also click anywhere in the image and command to the telescope to slew there. It is highly recommended to keep this option on. <guilabel>Overlay</guilabel> overlays captured images unto the sky map of &kstars;.

        This page tells Ekos whether you want to constrain your plate-solving search by scale or position.
        </para><para>Scale can be the image width in degrees (<guilabel>dw</guilabel>), the image width in arc-minutes (<guilabel>aw</guilabel>), or the pixel width in arc-seconds (<guilabel>app</guilabel>). All should work, but arc-seconds per pixel is recommended. Typically you want to use this constraint for faster solving, so we recommend you check this box. The system doesn't require that the scale be exactly right--it allows deviations of 10-20%. However, frequently issues related to solving are due to an inaccurate scale being used. Therefore, if you have plate-solving problems, you may want to uncheck <guilabel>Use Scale</guilabel> until those issues are resolved. This will likely result in longer solving times. <guilabel>Auto-update</guilabel> will automatically fill the scale box with the scale found in the most-recent successful solve.
        </para><para>The RA and DEC positions are usually filled in from the position the telescope thinks it is pointing. Naturally, the system doesn't require an exactly correct positional constraint--afterall the purpose of plate-solving is to find that position. The maximum distance in degrees from the specified position to the actual position is given by the <guilabel>Radius</guilabel> field. Plate-solving will fail if the specified position is further away.  Typically you want to enable <guilabel>Use Position</guilabel> for faster solving, so we recommend you check this box. However, frequently issues related to solving are due to using a poor positional estimate (e.g. the telescope is significantly misaligned). Therefore, if you have plate-solving problems, you may want to uncheck <guilabel>Use Position</guilabel> until those issues are resolved. As mentioned, this will result in longer solving times. <guilabel>Auto-update</guilabel> will fill the position box with the position found in the most-recent successful solve.

                You must download all the required files, and if you have plenty of hard drive space left, you can also download the recommended indexes. If an index file is installed, the checkmark shall be checked, otherwise check it to download the relevant index file. Please only download one file at a time, especially for larger files. You might be prompted to enter the administrator password (default in StellarMate is <userinput>smate</userinput>) to install the files. Once you installed all the required files, you can begin using the offline astrometry.net solver immediately.

                    You need to <ulink url="http://data.astrometry.net">download</ulink> and install the necessary index files suitable for your telescope+CCD field of view (FOV). You need to install index files covering 100% to 10% of your FOV. For example, if your FOV is 60 arcminutes, you need to install index files covering skymarks from 6 arcminutes (10%) to 60 arcminutes (100%). There are many online tools to calculate FOVs, such as <ulink url="http://starizona.com/acb/ccd/calc_pixel.aspx">Starizona Field of View Calculator</ulink>.

                Ekos Align Module offers multiple functions to aid you in achieving accurate GOTOs. For some mounts it is useful to start your session with your mount in home position with the telescope tube looking directly at the celestial pole. For users in Northern Hemisphere, point the telescope as close as possible to Polaris. It is not necessary to perform 2 or 3 star alignments, but it can be useful for some mount types. Make sure your camera is focused.

The astrometry results include the equatorial coordinates (RA &amp; DEC) of the center of the captured image and the pixel scale and field rotation. Depending on the Solver Action settings, the results can be used to Sync the mount or Sync and then Slew to the target location. For example, suppose you slewed the mount to Vega then used <emphasis>Capture &amp; Solve</emphasis>. If the actual telescope location is different from Vega, it will be first synced to the solved coordinate and then Ekos shall command the mount to slew to Vega. After slew is complete, the Alignment module will repeat Capture &amp; Solve process again until the error between reported and actual position falls below the accuracy thresholds (30 arcseconds by default).

                    When setting up a German Equatorial Mount (GEM) for imaging, a critical aspect of capturing long-exposure images is to ensure proper polar alignment. A GEM mount has two axis: Right Ascension (RA) axis and Declination (DE) axis. Ideally, the RA axis should be aligned with the celestial sphere polar axis. A mount's job is to track the star's motion around the sky, from the moment they rise at the eastern horizon, all the way up across the median, and westward until they set.

                    In long exposure imaging, a camera is attached to the telescope where the image sensor captures incoming photons from a particular area in the sky. The incident photons have to strike the same photo-site over and over again if we are to gather a clear and crisp image. Of course, actual photons do not behave in this way: optics, atmosphere, seeing quality all scatter and refract photons in one way or another. Furthermore, photons do not arrive uniformly but follow a Poisson distribution. For point-like sources like stars, a point spread function describes how photons are spatially distributed across the pixels. Nevertheless, the <emphasis>overall</emphasis> idea we want to keep the source photons hitting the same pixels. Otherwise, we might end up with an image plagued with various trail artifacts.

                    Since mounts are not perfect, they cannot perfectly keep track of object as it transits across the sky. This can stem from many factors, one of which is the misalignment of the mount's Right Ascension axis with respect to the celestial pole axis. Polar alignment removes one of the biggest sources of tracking errors in the mount, but other sources of error still play a factor. If properly aligned, some mounts can track an object for a few minutes with the only deviation of 1-2 arcsec RMS.

                    However, unless you have a top of the line mount, then you'd probably want to use an autoguider to keep the same star locked in the same position over time. Despite all of this, if the axis of the mount is not properly aligned with the celestial pole, then even a mechanically-perfect mount would lose tracking with time. Tracking errors are proportional to the magnitude of the misalignment. It is therefore very important for long exposure imaging to get the mount polar aligned to reduce any residual errors as it spans across the sky.

                    Before starting the process, point the mount as close as possible to the celestial pole with the counterweights down. If you are living in the Northern Hemisphere, point it as close as possible to Polaris. If Polaris is not visible (&eg; blocked by trees or  buildings) you may point elsewhere, preferably near the Meridian. Make sure there is at least 30-60 degrees of sky viewable in an arc East or West of the Meridian from the position you choose. Select the direction of free sky, the number of degrees for each of two slews, the mount slew speed, and whether the mount will be slewing automatically (recommended) or manually.

                    The tool works by capturing and solving three images. After capturing each, the mount rotates by the fixed amount you entered and another image is captured and solved. If you choose manual, you will need to slew the mount by roughly the angle chosen.

                  If you will be making corrections to your mount's axis, you should select the adjustment approach (we're using Plate Solve in this example), and how often the system should recapture images to re-measure the polar alignment error. The refresh interval should be frequent, but it doesn't make sense to make it faster that your CPU can capture and plate-solve the images. We're using 2s in this example. Then press the <guibutton>Refresh</guibutton> button to begin the correction process.

                  We also have an alternative schemes for correcting polar alignment. Two variations are <emphasis>Move Star &amp; Calc Error</emphasis> and <emphasis>Move Star</emphasis>. When you select this scheme, the system place a yellow/green/violet triangle on the screen. The triangle can be moved by clicking near a star, and the yellow/violet corner is moved to that star. In this scheme the user corrects polar alignment by first adjusting the mount's azimuth knob so that the selected star moves along the yellow side of the triangle. Once the star is near the next vertex, the azimuth knob should be adjusted so that the star moves along the green side of the triangle. Once the star is moved to the green/violet vertex, the mount is polar aligned, and the user can click <emphasis>stop</emphasis>.

                    The difference between <emphasis>Move Star &amp; Calc Error</emphasis> and  <emphasis>Move Star</emphasis> is that in the former, the system attempts to track the star the user has selected, and places a circle around that star. In that scheme it also attempts to update the <emphasis>Updated Err</emphasis> row. If the star tracking isn't reliable, simply ignore it or use the <emphasis> Move Star </emphasis>scheme and move the star by-eye until it's close to the final target. An example of using this technique is shown in this video:
