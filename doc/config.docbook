There is a list of over 3400 predefined cities available to choose from.
You set your location by highlighting a city from this list.  Each
city is represented in the world map as a small dot, and when a city
is highlighted in the list, a red crosshairs appears on its location
in the map.
</para>

<para>
<indexterm><primary>Geographic Location Tool</primary>
<secondary>Filtering</secondary></indexterm>
It is not practical to scroll through the full list of 3400 locations,
looking for a specific city. To make searches easier, the list can be
filtered by entering text in the boxes below the map. For example, in
the screenshot, the text <userinput>A</userinput> appears in the
<guilabel>City filter:</guilabel> box, while <userinput>Te</userinput> has been
entered in the <guilabel>Province filter:</guilabel> box, and
<userinput>USA</userinput> is in the <guilabel>Country filter:</guilabel>
box. Note that all of the cities displayed in the list have city,
province, and country names that begin with the entered filter
strings, and that the message below the filter boxes indicates that 6
cities are matched by the filters.  Also notice that the dots
representing these six cities in the map have been colored white,
while the unmatched cities remain gray.
</para><para>
The list can also be filtered by location in the map.  Clicking anywhere
in the world map will show only those cities within two degrees of the
clicked location.  At this time, you can search by name, or by location,
but not both at once.  In other words, when you click on the map, the
name filters are ignored, and vice versa.

<indexterm><primary>Geographic Location Tool</primary>
<secondary>Custom locations</secondary></indexterm>
The <link linkend="ai-geocoords">longitude, latitude</link> and
<link linkend="ai-timezones">time zone</link> information for the
currently-selected location are displayed in the boxes at the bottom of
the window.  If you feel that any of these values are inaccurate, you
can modify them and press the <guibutton>+</guibutton> (Add City) button
to record your custom version of the location.  You can also define a
completely new location by pressing the
<guibutton>Clear Fields</guibutton> button, and entering the data for
the new location.  Note that all fields except the optional
<guilabel>Province:</guilabel>/<guilabel>Country:</guilabel> must be filled before the new
location can be added to the list.  &kstars; will automatically load
your custom locations for all future sessions.  Please note, at this
point, the only way to remove a custom location is to remove the
appropriate line from the file <filename>kstars/mycities.dat</filename>
in your folder <userinput><command>qtpaths</command> <option>--paths GenericDataLocation</option></userinput>&nbsp;.

<secondary>The simulation clock</secondary></indexterm>
When &kstars; starts up, the time is set to your computer's system
clock, and the &kstars; clock is running to keep up with the real time.
If you want to stop the clock, select the <menuchoice><guimenu>Time</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Stop Clock</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item, or simply
click on the <guiicon>Stop Clock</guiicon> icon in the toolbar.  You can
make the clock run slower or faster than normal, or even make it run
backward, using the time-step spinbox in the toolbar.  This spinbox
has two sets of up/down buttons.  The first one will step through all
83 available time steps, one by one.  The second one will skip to the
next higher (or lower) unit of time, which allows you to make large
timestep changes more quickly.

<secondary>Extended range of dates</secondary></indexterm>
&kstars; can accept very remote dates beyond the usual limits imposed by
QDate.  Currently, you can set the date between the years -100000 and +100000.
We may extend this range even further in future releases.  However, please
be aware that the accuracy of the simulation becomes more and more degraded
as more remote dates are examined.  This is especially true for the positions
of solar system bodies.

The <guilabel>Stars</guilabel> section allows you to manage how stars are
displayed in &kstars;. You can choose to see the stars or not by checking the
<guilabel>Star catalogs</guilabel> checkbox. If you check it, then multiple
options will be enabled. Thus, you can set how many stars are drawn on the map
using the <guilabel>Star density:</guilabel> slider. You can also customize
&kstars; to toggle star name and <link linkend="ai-magnitude">magnitudes</link>.
Star names are drawn next to bright stars. To display labels of fainter stars,
increase the <guilabel>Label density:</guilabel> slider.
</para>

<para>
<indexterm><primary>Catalogs</primary>
<secondary>Deep-Sky Catalogs</secondary></indexterm>
Below the stars section, the <guilabel>Deep-Sky Objects</guilabel> section controls
the display of several non-stellar object catalogs. You can toggle the display of
Deep Sky Objects and control the display of their names and magnitudes. By default,
the list of deep-sky objects includes the Messier, NGC and IC catalogs.
Addons catalogs are available via the
<menuchoice><guimenu>Data</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Download New Data...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
menu item where you can download catalogs provided by &kstars; team and the community through
the <ulink url="https://invent.kde.org/vboettcher/kstars-catalogs">catalog
packaging repository</ulink>. The <guilabel>DSO minimal zoom:</guilabel>
slider controls the minimal zoom level for which the
DSOs are shown. Increasing the minimal zoom level can lead to
performance improvements when panning the skymap zoomed-out.
The <guilabel>DSO cache percentage:</guilabel> slider regulates how
much of the DSO master catalog is being kept in memory. If you
experience memory issues with large catalogs, try lowering the
percentage. The <guilabel>Label density:</guilabel> slider controls
the perceived density of labels for the DSOs. If labels start to
overlap and the skymap begins to look too crowded, try tuning this
option. The <guilabel>Faint limit zoomed in/out:</guilabel> regulates up to which
magnitude objects are shown on the skymap (higher magnitude is
fainter). If <guilabel>Show objects of unknown magnitude</guilabel> is
ticked, objects of unknown magnitude are always shown.
</para>
<para>The following sections will detail how DSO catalogs work in
&kstars; and how they're managed.</para>

<secondary>Database</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Deep-Sky Catalogs</primary>
  <secondary>Database System</secondary></indexterm>
<note>
  <para>
    This section aims at introducing the catalog database of &kstars; in
    simple but technical terms. It can be skipped without missing anything
    essential but helps understanding how to deal with and create (custom)
    catalogs.
  </para>
</note>
<para>
DSO catalogs  in &kstars; are  just SQL (sqlite3) database  tables. Each
catalog is represented by its own table which contains all its objects
and an entry in a catalog  metadata table. Additionally, catalogs may be
imported or exported from and into stand-alone database  files.
</para>

<para>
Each object has the usual properties like name and coordinates but
additionally features two IDs. The first ID is the unique identifier
for the specific object and is calculated by hashing all the object fields
along with the catalog id. Because objects can be contained in several
catalogs each object has an additional object id (OID) that identifies
the physical object and may be shared by several objects of different
catalogs.
</para>

<para>
To speed up object lookup all enabled catalogs are merged into a
master table. Each catalog has a priority number and if several
objects with the same OID occur the one from the catalog with the
highest priority is loaded. The objects from the master catalog are
then drawn on the sky and generally available in &kstars;.
</para>

<para>
Currently, deduplication (the assignment of OIDs) is only supported by
the tooling of
the <ulink url="https://invent.kde.org/vboettcher/kstars-catalogs">catalog
packaging repository</ulink>. The aim of this tool-chain is to
reproducibly build catalogs in a homogeneous environment. Every
catalog is
implemented <ulink url="https://invent.kde.org/vboettcher/kstars-catalogs/-/blob/master/catalogs/sharpless_2.py">
as a python module</ulink> and provides standard methods to acquire
data, parse it and find duplicates in other catalogs. All
downloadable catalogs are implemented this way. If you'd like to make
a catalog of your own available for &kstars;, it is recommended that you
implement it as a package in the repository. The tooling provided
there is so flexible, that it should work for you. For more
information on how to do that see
the <ulink url="https://protagon.space/catalogs/">catalog repository
documentation</ulink>. If you are not familiar with python programming
you can request the addition of a catalog by opening a ticket in the
repository or
contacting <ulink url="https://invent.kde.org/vboettcher/kstars-catalogs/-/project_members">the
maintainers</ulink>. &kstars; provides also provides means to create
custom catalogs by manually entering data or importing CSV tables, but
those are less flexible and offer no deduplication.

The <guilabel>Satellites</guilabel> page allows you to set the satellites view options. Firstly,
you can see or hide the satellites on the skymap using <guilabel>Show satellites</guilabel> checkbox
from the top <guilabel>View Options</guilabel> section. By default, satellites are drawn as small
light red filled circles with an optional dark red name label next to them. You can enable or disable
these labels by checking or not the <guilabel>Show labels</guilabel> checkbox. It is located below
the <guilabel>Show satellites</guilabel> checkbox, within the <guilabel>View Options</guilabel> section.
</para>
<para>
The colors of the dots representing satellites and their name labels can be easily customized using
the <guilabel>Colors</guilabel> page from the same <guilabel>Configure - &kstars;</guilabel> window.
In addition, satellites can be drawn just like regular stars by checking the <guilabel>Draw satellites
like stars</guilabel> checkbox. To display only the visible satellites from your current geographic location
and time, select <guilabel>Show only visible satellites</guilabel>.
</para>
<para>
&kstars; can draw artificial satellites from many predefined groups. Thus, you can select to display a particular
group, multiple groups or partially select subgroups. Under each group, a list of individual satellites is
presented. To select all satellites from a group, you need to check the group checkbox. You can also select
only the satellites of interest in each group.
The satellites orbital elements can be updated via the internet by pressing the <guibutton>Update TLEs</guibutton>
button. Another way for updating the satellites orbital elements is to use the <menuchoice><guimenu>Data</guimenu>
<guisubmenu>Updates</guisubmenu> <guimenuitem>Update Satellites Orbital Elements</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu
item. If you know the name of a desired satellite then you can use the search satellites method that &kstars;
provides. You need to enter the name of satellite in the <guilabel>Search satellites</guilabel> text box and the
list will be reduced only to its best matches.
</para>
<para>
You can add new satellites to &kstars; default satellites set by editing the
<filename>kstars/data/satellites.dat</filename> file. As each line of this file is a group of
satellites, you need to add a new entry for your desired satellites group.
An entry should have the following format: <userinput>Group Name;local_filename;url</userinput>.

The <guilabel>Terrain</guilabel> page lets you configure whether the terrain (landscape) image will be shown on the skymap.
</para>
<para>
The user is responsible for creating a partially-transparent image, that is overlayed onto the sky map. This image should have transparent regions that the user creates to let the skymap show through, and opaque regions representing the trees, buildings, the landscape around the telescope. There is a particular format required, and this is a significant effort. There are many resources on the web that explain how this is done for <ulink url="https://stellarium.org/landscapes.html">Stellarium</ulink>. The details of image creation are the same.
</para>
<para>
Initially, the user captures a full sphere equirectangular projection image from approximately the same point-of-view as his/her telescope. This kind of image can be captured with the Google Camera App, or the Google YouTube App on iPhone, or likely many other camera apps. The user then needs to edit the resulting image so that the sky is erased/transparent, and save it as a PNG. Finally, the user needs to determine where North is in the image, so it can eventually be aligned with the skymap. Once all that is done, the sky map can simulate the local sky view including the local terrain.
</para>
<para>
Once the image is created, it is possible to upload it via the <guilabel>Terrain</guilabel> page and configure the azimuth correction value (in degrees) that allows the user to rotate the view so north in the sky map is aligned with the north in the image.
</para>
<para>
Moreover, some speedup options can be configured to achieve the best user experience when rendering the terrain on the sky map.

a <link linkend="ai-colorandtemp">realistic color</link> tint according
to the spectral type of the star.  However, you may also choose to draw
the stars as solid white, black or red circles.  If you are using the
realistic star colors, you can set the saturation level of the star
colors with the <guilabel>Star color intensity:</guilabel> spinbox.
</para>
<para>
The right panel lists the defined color schemes.  There are four
predefined schemes: the <guilabel>Default Colors</guilabel> scheme,
<guilabel>Star Chart</guilabel>, which uses black stars on a white
background, <guilabel>Night Vision</guilabel>, which uses only shades
of red in order to protect dark-adapted vision, and <guilabel>Moonless

you can save the current color settings as a custom scheme by clicking
the <guibutton>Save As...</guibutton> button.  It will prompt
you for a name for the new scheme, and then your scheme will appear in

The <guilabel>Correct for atmospheric refraction</guilabel> checkbox
controls whether the positions of objects are corrected for the effects
of the atmosphere.  Because the atmosphere is a spherical shell, light from
outer space is <quote>bent</quote> as it passes through the atmosphere to
our telescopes or eyes on the Earth's surface.  The effect is largest for
objects near the horizon, and actually changes the predicted rise or set
times of objects by a few minutes.  In fact, when you <quote>see</quote> a
sunset, the Sun's actual position is already well below the horizon;
atmospheric refraction makes it seem as if the Sun is still in the sky.

There are three situations when &kstars; must redraw the sky display very

a large load on the <abbrev>CPU</abbrev>.  If the <abbrev>CPU</abbrev>
cannot keep up with the demand, then the display will seem sluggish or jerky.
To mitigate this, &kstars; will hide certain objects during these rapid-redraw
situations, as long as the <guilabel>Hide objects while moving</guilabel>
checkbox is selected.  The timestep threshold above which objects will be

<guisubmenu>Toolbars Shown</guisubmenu></menuchoice> submenu.  Like most &kde; toolbars,
they can also be dragged around and anchored on any window edge, or even detached from
the window completely if they are unlocked.

Select a different color scheme in the <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu>
<guisubmenu>Color Schemes</guisubmenu></menuchoice> submenu.  There are four predefined
color schemes, and you can define your own in the

Choose an <quote>FOV Symbol</quote> using the
<menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guisubmenu>FOV Symbols</guisubmenu></menuchoice>
submenu.  <firstterm>FOV</firstterm> is an acronym for <quote>field-of-view</quote>.
An FOV symbol is drawn at the center of the window to indicate where the display
is pointing.  Different symbols have different angular sizes; you can use a symbol to show
what the view through a particular telescope would look like.  For example, if you choose
the <quote>7x35 Binoculars</quote> FOV symbol, then a circle is drawn on the display that is
9.2 degrees in diameter; this is the field-of-view for 7x35 binoculars.

You can define your own FOV symbols (or modify the existing symbols) using the
<guimenuitem>Edit FOV Symbols...</guimenuitem> menu item, which launches the FOV Editor:

The list of defined FOV symbols is displayed on the left.  On the right are buttons for
adding a new symbol, editing the highlighted symbol's properties, and removing the
highlighted symbol from the list.  Note that you can even modify or remove the four
predefined symbols (if you remove all symbols, the four defaults will be restored the
next time you start &kstars;).  Below these three buttons is a graphical preview display
showing the highlighted symbol from the list.  When the <guibutton>New...</guibutton> or
<guibutton>Edit...</guibutton> button is pressed, the <guilabel>New FOV Indicator</guilabel>
window is opened:

This window lets you modify the four properties that define a FOV symbol: name, size,
shape, and color.  The angular size for the symbol can either be entered directly in the
<guilabel>Field of View</guilabel> edit box, or you can use the Eyepiece/Camera Tabs to
calculate the field-of-view angle, given parameters of your telescope/eyepiece or
telescope/camera setup.  The five available shapes are: Square, Circle, Crosshairs, Bullseye and Semitransparent circle.
Once you have specified all four parameters, press <guibutton>Ok</guibutton>,
and the symbol will appear in the list of defined symbols.  It will also be available
from the <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guisubmenu>FOV Symbols</guisubmenu></menuchoice> submenu.
