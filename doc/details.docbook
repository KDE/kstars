The Object Details Window presents advanced data available about
a specific object in the sky.  To access this tool,
<mousebutton>right</mousebutton>-click on any object, and select the
<guimenuitem>Details...</guimenuitem> item from the popup menu.
</para>
<para>
The window is divided into a number of tabs.  In the
<guilabel>General</guilabel> tab, we present basic data about
the current object.  This includes names and catalog designations,
object type, and <link linkend="ai-magnitude">magnitude</link>
(brightness).  On the <guilabel>Position</guilabel> tab
are the object's Equatorial and Horizontal
coordinates, as well as its rise, set and transit times.

In the <guilabel>Links</guilabel> tab, you can manage the internet
links associated with this object.  The Image and Information links
associated with the object are listed.  These are the links that
appear in the popup menu when the object is
<mousebutton>right</mousebutton>-clicked.  You can add custom
links to the object with the <guibutton>Add Link...</guibutton>
button.  This will open a window in which you fill in the &URL; and link
text for the new link (you can also test the &URL; in the web browser
from this window).  Every time you add a custom &URL; to a certain object,
you are able to choose the resource type using the <guibutton>Resource Type</guibutton>
button. Keep in mind that the custom link can easily point
to a file on your local disk, so you can use this feature to index
your personal astronomical images or observing logs.

<para>
You can also modify or remove any link using the
<guibutton>Edit Link...</guibutton> and
<guibutton>Remove Link...</guibutton> buttons.

<para>
The <guilabel>Advanced</guilabel> tab (not available for all objects) allows you to query professional
astronomical databases on the internet for information regarding the
current object.  To use these databases, double click on the
desired database in the list to see the results of your query in a web browser window.  The
query is made using the primary name of the object you clicked on to
open the Details Dialog.  The following databases are available for
querying:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><guimenuitem>Set of Identifications, Measurements, and Bibliography
for Astronomical Data (SIMBAD)</guimenuitem>: SIMBAD is similar to NED, except it
provides data about all kinds of objects, not just galaxies.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><guimenuitem>SkyView</guimenuitem>: Provides images from All-Sky surveys that have
been performed in dozens of different parts of the spectrum, from
Gamma Rays to the Radio.  The &kstars; interface will retrieve an image
from any of these surveys, centered on the selected object.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><guimenuitem>High Energy Astrophysical Archive (HEASARC)</guimenuitem>: Here you
can retrieve data about the current object from a number of
<quote>High-energy</quote> observatories, which covers the
Ultraviolet, X-ray and Gamma Ray portions of the electromagnetic
spectrum.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><guimenuitem>NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED)</guimenuitem>: NED provides
encapsulated data and bibliographic links about
extragalactic objects.  You should only use NED if your target is
extragalactic; &ie; if it is itself a galaxy.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><guimenuitem>NASA Astrophysical Data System (ADS)</guimenuitem>: This
incredible bibliographic database encompass the entire body of
literature published in international peer-review Journals about
astronomy and astrophysics.  The database is divided into four
general subject areas (Astronomy and Astrophysics, Astrophysics
Preprints, Instrumentation, and Physics and Geophysics).  Each of these
has three sub-nodes that query the database
in different ways.  <quote>Keyword search</quote> will return articles
which listed the object's name as a keyword.  <quote>Title word
search</quote> will return articles which included the object name in
their Title, and the <quote>Title &amp; Keyword search</quote> uses
both options together.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><guimenuitem>Multimission Archive at Space Telescope (MAST)</guimenuitem>:
The <ulink url="https://www.stsci.edu/">Space Telescope Science Institute</ulink> provides access to the entire
collection of images and spectra taken with the Hubble Space
Telescope, as well as several other space-based observatories.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
Finally, in the <guilabel>Log</guilabel> tab, you can type in some text
that will remain associated with this object's <guilabel>Details</guilabel> window.
You could use this to attach personal observing notes, for example. Your notes
will be saved, such that you can easily read or use them next time when you will
use &kstars;.
