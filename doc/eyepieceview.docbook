      On the left hand side is the sky map shot from &kstars;. On the right hand side is the POSS (DSS) image of the same region. The orientation in the above example has been adjusted to match the view through a Dobsonian telescope at the location and time of the simulation in &kstars;.

<para>
This tool simulates how an object looks through your eyepiece. In addition to rendering the eyepiece field, &kstars; can also fetch and overlay the DSS imagery. Additionally, if you are using a Dobsonian telescope, you can rotate the field of view to match the eyepiece view.
</para>

<para>To use this feature, first define your eyepieces' fields of view using the <link linkend="customize">FOV Symbol editor</link>.</para>
 
<para>Then there are two ways to invoke the feature:
<itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>In Sky Map, right click on the desired object and click <guilabel>Simulate eyepiece view</guilabel> in the popup menu.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>In observation planner, right click an object and click <guilabel>Simulate eyepiece view</guilabel> in the popup menu.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
    
<para>When the tool is first invoked, it will prompt a dialog to select the desired FOV to render the view. To compare the rendered view against a real sky image, click the <guibutton>Fetch DSS image</guibutton> button to download a DSS image. You can manually adjust the view to match your eyepiece using the rotation slider, the <guilabel>invert view</guilabel> and <guilabel>flip view</guilabel> check boxes. Alternatively, you can use a pre-calculated amount of rotation by using one of the <guilabel>Presets</guilabel> that is tailored for different optical systems.</para>
