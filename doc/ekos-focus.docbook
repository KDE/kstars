    <para> In order to focus an image, Ekos needs to establish a numerical
    method for gauging how <emphasis>good</emphasis> your focus is. It's easy
    when you look at an image and can see it as
    <emphasis>unfocused</emphasis>, as the human eye is very good at detecting
    that, but <emphasis>how</emphasis> can Ekos possibly know that? </para>

    <para> There are multiple methods. One is to calculate the Full Width at
    Half Maximum (FHWM) of a star profile within an image, and then adjust the
    focus until an optimal (narrower) FWHM is reached. The problem with FWHM
    is that it assumes the initial focus position to be close to the critical
    focus. Additionally, FWHM does not perform very well under low-intensity
    fluxes. An Alternative method is Half-Flux-Radius (HFR), which is a
    measure of the width in pixels counting from the center of the star until
    the accumulated intensity is half of the total flux of the star. HFR
    proved to be much more stable in conditions where you might have
    unfavorable sky conditions, when the brightness profile of the stars is
    low, and when the starting position of the focus is far from the optimal
    focus. </para>

    <para> After Ekos processes an image, it selects either a single star and
    starts measuring its HFR, or it selects a set of stars matching the
    criteria that have been set and calculates an average HFR. It can
    automatically select stars, or you can select a single star manually. It
    is recommended to allow Ekos to select a set of stars. </para>

    <para> Ekos supports 4 different focus algorithms: Iterative, Polynominal,
    Linear and Linear 1 Pass. </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para> <emphasis role="bold">Iterative</emphasis>: In the Iterative
        algorithm, Ekos operates iteratively by moving in discrete steps,
        decided initially by the user-configurable step size and later by the
        slope of the V-Curve, to get closer to the optimal focus position
        where it then changes gears and performs smaller, finer moves to reach
        the optimal focus. The focus process stops when the measured HFR is
        within the configurable tolerance of the minimum recorded HFR in the
        process. In other words, whenever the process starts searching for a
        solution within a narrowly limited range, it checks if the current HFR
        is within % difference compared to the minimum HFR recorded, and if
        this condition is met then the Autofocus process is considered
        successful. The default value is set to 1% and is sufficient for most
        situations. The Step options specify the number of initial ticks the
        focuser has to move. If the image is severely out of focus, we set the
        step size high (i.e. greater than 250). On the other hand, if the
        focus is close to optimal focus, we set the step size to a more
        reasonable range (less than 50). It takes trial and error to find the
        best starting tick, but Ekos only uses that for the first focus
        motion, as all subsequent motions depend on the V-Curve slope
        calculations. Key features include:</para>

        <para> <emphasis role="bold">Polynomial</emphasis>: In the Polynomial
        algorithm, the process starts off in Iterative mode, but once we cross
        to the other side of the V-Curve (once HFR values start increasing
        again after decreasing for a while), then Ekos performs quadratic
        curve fitting to find a solution that predicts the minimum possible
        HFR position. Key features include:</para>

        <para> <emphasis role="bold">Linear</emphasis>: In the Linear
        algorithm, Ekos steps outward from its starting point then moves
        inward taking regular datapoints through the point of optimum focus
        and then further inward, to draw a V-Curve. It then fits a quadratic
        curve to the datapoints and calculates the point of optimum focus. It
        then moves out again past the point of optimum focus, halves the
        stepsize and moves in again for a second pass. It looks to follow the
        curve from the first pass and find the minimum HFR. Due to randomness
        in the HFR measurements it uses the % tolerance to help decide when it
        has found a solution. Key features include: </para>

    <para> All INDI-compatible focusers are supported. It is recommended to
    use <emphasis role="bold">absolute</emphasis> focusers for the best
    results since their absolute position is known on power up. In INDI, the
    focuser <emphasis>zero</emphasis> position is when the drawtube is
    <emphasis role="bold">fully retracted</emphasis>. When focusing
    <emphasis>outwards</emphasis>, the focuser position increases, while it
    decreases when focusing <emphasis>inwards</emphasis>. The following
    focuser types are supported: </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para> <emphasis role="bold">Absolute</emphasis>: Absolute Position
        Focusers such as RoboFocus, MoonLite, ASI ZWO </para>

        Focusers. </para>

        focusers with no position feedback that adjust focus position by
        moving for a certain amount of time. </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para> Start off by selecting the Focuser from the dropdown. </para>

    <para> For absolute focusers, you can set the ticks count in the Initial
    Steps Size field in the <link linkend="focus-mechanics">Mechanics</link>
    tab. For absolute and relative focusers, the step size is in units of
    <emphasis>ticks</emphasis> and for simple, or time based, focusers, the
    step size is in <emphasis>milliseconds</emphasis>. The
    <guibutton>In</guibutton> and <guibutton>Out</guibutton> buttons can then
    be used to move the focuser by this number of ticks.</para>

    <para> The Steps fields will initially contain the starting point in ticks
    for the focuser. As the focuser moves, the left field will update to
    reflect the focuser's current position. The right field will initially
    contain the starting position of the focuser but will update each time a
    successful Autofocus run completes, to keep a last good focus position. In
    addition you can set the right field to whatever value you like, and use
    the <guibutton>Goto</guibutton> button to move the focuser to this
    position.</para>

    <para> The <guibutton>Goto Focus Position</guibutton> button moves the
    focuser to the position in the righthand Steps field. </para>

    <para> The <guibutton>Stop Focuser Motion</guibutton> button stops the
    in-progress focuser motion. </para>

    <para> The <guibutton>Auto Focus</guibutton> button starts an Autofocus
    run. The <guibutton>Stop</guibutton> button is used to stop the run.
    </para>

    <para> The <guibutton>Capture Image</guibutton> button will take a frame
    based on the current settings in the <guilabel>CCD and Filter
    Wheel</guilabel> group. The <guibutton>Start Framing</guibutton> button
    will start repeatedly capturing frames until the
    <guibutton>Stop</guibutton> button is pressed. </para>

    <para> Some of the focus algorithms will attempt to cope with being
    started away from the point of optimum focus, but for predictable results,
    it is best to start from a position of being approximately in focus. For
    first time setup, <guibutton>Start Framing</guibutton> can be used along
    with the <guibutton>In</guibutton> and <guibutton>Out</guibutton> buttons
    to adjust the focus position to roughly minimise the HFR of the stars in
    the captured images. When Framing is used in this way, the <link
    linkend="focus-v-curve">V-Curve</link> graph changes to show a time series
    of frames and their associated HFRs. This makes the framing process much
    easier to perform.</para>

    <para> If you are completely new to astronomy, it is always a good idea to
    get familiar with your equipment in daylight. This includes getting the
    approximate focus position on a distant object. This will provide a good
    starting position for focusing on stars when nighttime comes.</para>

    <para> Set the CCD to be used in the focus process from the dropdown. The
    <guibutton>Live Video</guibutton> button brings up the associated popup.
    Next set the exposure length. The <guibutton>Toggle Full

    to a separate window. Pressing it again returns it within the focus
    window. The <guibutton>Show in FITS Viewer</guibutton> button pops-up a
    separate FITS Viewer window to display the focus frame, in addition to
    focus frame displayed within the focus window.</para>

    <para> The next row of controls allows CCD parameters to be set. Choose a
    value from the binning dropdown and then set either the camera gain or
    ISO.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para> <guilabel>Binning</guilabel>: Increasing the binning will
        change the image scale as well as resulting in brighter pixels. A good
        place to start would be 1x1 and then see whether better results can be
        obtained by binning at higher levels such as 2x2 or 4x4.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para> <guilabel>Gain / ISO</guilabel>: Set the Gain / ISO for the CCD
        being used to focus. The value needs to be high enough to give a clear
        star pattern but not so high as to create too much noise to interfere
        with the focus operation. Some experimentation will be required to
        find an optimum value. If you are unsure where to start try unity gain
        for your camera and adjust from there.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para> The next row of controls deals with the Filter Wheel, if there is
    one. Firstly, choose the Filter Wheel from the dropdown and the filter to
    use. To start focusing it will probably be easier to select the filter
    that allows the most light through, for example the Lum filter. The
    <guibutton>Filter Settings</guibutton> button brings up the <link
    linkend="capture-filter-settings">Filter Settings</link> popup. This
    allows a number of parameters to be set per filter to be used during an
    Autofocus run which could be unattended so a user would not be available
    to set parameters at run time. Broadly these allow two types of focus
    runs:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para> <emphasis role="bold">Per Filter</emphasis>: When another
        module, for example, the Capture module requires a filter change, it
        is possible to automatically refocus for the new filter. The exposure
        to use for each filter is taken from the <link
        linkend="capture-filter-settings">Filter Settings</link> popup. This
        is very useful where, for example, narrowband filter require longer
        exposure times than broadband filters.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para> <emphasis role="bold">Lock Filter</emphasis>: It is possible to
        specify a Lock filter to use when it is required to focus another
        filter. For example, if a Red filter is used and an Autofocus run
        required, it is possible to run the Autofocus using the Lum filter and
        then, when complete, adjust the focus position by an Offset value
        corresponding to the predetermined focus difference between the Lum
        and Red filters. This is useful when, for example, it is difficult to
        focus some filters directly without excessively long exposure times.
        Note that this locked filter approach may also used in the <link
        linkend="ekos-align">Alignment Module</link> whenever it performs a
        capture for astrometry.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para> You may select the temperature source from the dropdown on the next
    row of controls. Underneath are displayed the current temperature from the
    selected temperature source and the change in temperature between when the
    last successful Autofocus run completed and the current temperature. It is
    common practice to redo focus after significant temperature changes that
    alter the telescope's focus point. You may reset the focusing subframe to
    full frame capture if you click the <guibutton>Reset</guibutton> button.

        for focusing. Enabling subframing can speed up the focus

        doughnut are discounted from processing. Setting an inner value above
        0% causes stars in the centre of the FOV to be discarded. This could
        be useful to avoid using stars in the target of the image (for example
        a galaxy) for focusing purposes. Setting an outer value below 100%
        causes stars in the edges of the FOV to be discarded during focusing.
        This could be useful if you do not have a flat field out to the edges
        of your FOV.</para>

        scope, for example when using an Off Axis Guider. The purpose of this

        selected. The option calculates the standard deviation of star HFRs
        and uses the square of this (mathematically the variance) as a
        weighting in the curve fitting process. The advantage of this is that
        datapoints with less reliable data and therefore larger HFR standard
        deviations will be given less weight than more reliable datapoints. If

        Autofocus algorithms. The purpose is to protect the focuser from
        travelling too far and potentially damaging itself. On the other hand,
        the value needs to be big enough to allow sufficient focuser motion to
        permit the auto focus runs to complete.</para>

      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para> <guilabel>Backlash</guilabel>: All mechanical devices with
        gears suffer from backlash. In a typical focuser there will be a dead
        zone where changing direction (e.g. from “in” to “out”) results in
        movement of the focuser by a few ticks, but no actual movement of the
        optical train.</para>

        <para>The Linear 1 Pass algorithm (like the Linear algorithm) provides
        backlash compensation in the 2 places during an auto focus run when
        the focuser moves outwards:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para> The initial outward movement of Initial Step Size * Out

            the best focus position and moves outward to it.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para> Linear 1 Pass will extend (by x ticks) the outward movement,
        and then, as a separate movement it will move inward by x ticks. So it
        always approaches the desired position in an inward direction.</para>

        <para>There are 2 schemes that can be used:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Set Backlash to 0. Ekos will use a value of 5 * Initial Step
            Size.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Set Backlash &gt; 0. EKOS will use this value in its
            backlash calculations. There will probably be instructions with
            your focuser for determining the value of Backlash. It is not
            necessary to set an exact value for either Linear or Linear 1 Pass
            to work correctly; all that is required is that the value set in
            Backlash is &gt;= the actual backlash value. For example, if you
            measure backlash and get a value around 100, any value &gt;=100
            will work equally well. For example, set Backlash = 200.</para>

            It will need a minimum of just over Initial Step Size * Out Step

            moving the focuser then taking a few frames at the same position.
            If the first frame after movement has bigger HFRs than subsequent

            Which gives a max / min just over 1. The other clue that this is a
            poor setup is that the Error Bar range is very large compared to
            HFR movement which means that the curve solver is drawing a curve
            through a lot of noise, which means the results will not be very
            accurate.</para>

    <title>Coefficient of Determination, R2</title>

    <para> The Coefficient of Determination, or R2, is calculated in order to
    give a measure of how well the fitted curve matches the datapoints. More
    information is available <ulink
    url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination">here</ulink>.
    This is an experimental feature that is available for the Linear 1 Pass
    focus algorithm. In essence, R2 gives a value between 0 and 1, with 1
    meaning a perfect fit where all datapoints sit on the curve, and 0 meaning
    that there is no correlation between the datapoints and the curve. The
    user should experiment with their equipment to see what values they can
    obtain, but as a guide, a value above, say 0.8 would be a good fit.</para>

    <para> There is an option to set an “R2 Limit” in the Settings tab of the
    Focus window that is compared to the calculated R2 after the auto focu run
    has completed. If the limit value has not been achieved, then the auto
    focus is rerun.</para>

    <para> Setting an R2 Limit could be useful for unattended observation if
    the focus run produces a bad result for a 1-off reason. Obviously if the
    reason is not transitory then rerunning will not improve anything.</para>

    <para> If the R2 Limit is not achieved and the focus process is rerun, and
    again fails to achieve the R2 Limit, then the focus run is marked as
    successful to avoid the process getting stuck rerunning auto focus
    forever.</para>

    <para> This feature is turned off by setting the R2 Limit to 0.</para>

    <para> The Levenberg-Marquart algorithm is a new feature added for the
    Linear 1 Pass focus algorithm. It is a non-linear least-squares solver and
    thus suitable for many different equations. The basic idea is to adjust
    the equation y = f(x,P) so that the computed y values are as close as
    possible to the y values of the datapoints provided, so that the resultant
    curve fits the data as best as it can. P is a set of parameters that are
    varied by the solver in order to find the best fit. The solver measures
    how far away the curve is at each data point, squares the result and adds
    them all up. This is the number to be minimised, lets call is S. The
    solver is supplied with an initial guess for the parameters, P. It
    calculates S, makes an adjustment to P and calculates a new S1. Provided
    S1 &lt; S then we are moving in the right direction. It iterates through
    the procedure until:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para> the delta in S is less than a supplied limit (convergence has
        been reached), or</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para> the maximum number of iterations has been reached, or</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para> the solver encountered an error.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para> The solver is capable of solving either an unweighted or weighted
    set of datapoints. In essence, an unweighted set of data gives equal
    weight to each datapoint when trying to fit a curve. An alternative is to
    weight each datapoint with a measure that corresponds to how accurate the
    measurement of the datapoint actually is. In our case this is the variance
    of star HFRs associated with the datapoint. The variance is the standard
    deviation squared.</para>

    <para> Currently the solver is used to fit either a parabolic or a
    hyperbolic curve.</para>
