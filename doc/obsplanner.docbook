  <title>Observation Planner</title>
  <indexterm>
    <primary>Planner</primary>
  </indexterm>
  <para>Since &kde; SC 4.4, Prakash Mohan&apos;s GSoC work has been released in &kstars;. &kstars; now
has an awesome observation planner to plan your observation sessions. The execute session option allows
you to log information about objects as you observe them. Alternately, you may also write a short log
in the session planner itself. We wish you a lot of fun planning your observations with &kstars;!
  </para>
  <para>You can even add some pictures to the objects. The image list is a Google image search list.
To add image to an object just press <guibutton>Find Image</guibutton> button on the right and then
find an image that you like. If you do not have an Internet connection you can open an image from
your hard drive. Note that images that will be used are going to be cropped to 600x600 pixels.
  </para>
  <para>The first way of doing this is by pressing <keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>2</keycap></keycombo> or <keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>L</keycap></keycombo> to open the Observation List, then press the <guibutton>Add Object</guibutton> button.</para>

  <para>The <guibutton>Download all Images</guibutton> button does a search for the SDSS images and displays the DSS image if the requested RA/Dec is out of the SDSS footprint.</para>

  <para>You can add more objects by pressing the <guibutton>Find Object</guibutton> button. It will open
the <guilabel>Find Object</guilabel> tool which provides two accurate methods for sorting out the items,
depending on what criteria you want to use.
You can filter the list by objects type: Any, Stars, Solar System, Clusters (Globular and Open),
Nebulae (Gaseous and Planetary), Galaxies, Comets, Asteroids, Constellations, Supernovae or Satellites.
You can also filter the objects list by name. Enter the name of desired object
in the <guilabel>Filter by name</guilabel> text box.
  </para>

  <para>Inside Observation Planner window you can see the <quote>Altitude vs Time</quote> widget (AltvsTime),
which shows you how the altitude of a selected object varies over time.
  </para>
  <para>Below the AltvsTime widget, there is a text box in that you can add observing notes for current sky object.
  </para>
  <para>Note that the Wish List is not the Session Plan. In the Wish List you can add objects
that you wish to observe at some point. From there you can add them to the Session Plan.
  </para>
  <para>You can see the pop-up window that comes after right-clicking on an object.</para>

  <para>Here is the second way of adding objects in your Observation Plan, using the Observing List Wizard. You
just need to press the fourth button on the top-left corner of the Observation Planner window.</para>
  <para>Despite looking differently this way is basically the same as the first one. Although that
it could be a bit more detailed. Here you can see the same categories of objects.

  <para>You can choose where these objects to be on the sky. There are four options available for you: All over the sky (which is the default option), by constellation and in a region (rectangular or circular).</para>

  <para>Another way of adding objects to your observation plan is using the newly introduced <guibutton>Batch Add</guibutton> will open up a text box where you can type many objects to add in one shot to the observation planner. Any objects not in the &kstars; database already will be resolved using SIMBAD Astronomical Database (provided this has been enabled in the Settings) and added to the database. The entire process of adding objects is slow and may take a while, and you can watch the progress in the Status Bar. Any objects that could not be found are then listed in an error message, so you can identify and fix the errors. Usually this may be because SIMBAD expects a different way of specifying the object (&eg; Sim 147 instead of Simeis 147). This new feature allows you to easily scrape data from observing lists on the web &etc; and add them to your workflow in &kstars;.
  </para>
  <para>This is how the <guilabel>Execution Session</guilabel> Window look. It can be opened by pressing <keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>2</keycap></keycombo>. In it you can also see some information about the selected object and you are able to add observing notes.</para>
