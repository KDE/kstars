        <para>
            Ekos Scheduler is an indispensable arsenal in building your robotic observatory. A Robotic observatory is an observatory composed of several subsystems that are orchestrated together to achieve a set of scientific objectives without human intervention. It is the only Ekos module that does not require Ekos to be started as it is utilized to <emphasis>start</emphasis> and <emphasis>stop</emphasis> Ekos. It is designed to be straightforward and intuitive. However, the scheduler should only be used after you mastered Ekos and knows all the quirks of your equipment. Since the complete process is automated, including focus, guiding, and meridian flip, all equipment should be thoroughly used with Ekos and all their parameters and settings adjusted to achieve the best result.
        </para>
        <para>
            With Ekos, the user can utilize the powerful sequence queue to image batches of images for a particular target. In simple setups, the user is expected to focus the CCD, align the mount, frame the target, and start guiding before initiating the capture process. For more complex observatory environments, there are usually predefined custom procedures to be executed to prepare the observatory for imaging, and another set of procedures on shutdown. The user may plan to image one or more targets during the night and expects data to be ready by morning. In &kstars;, tools such as the <link linkend="tool-obsplanner">Observation Planner</link> and <link linkend="tool-whatsup">What's up Tonight</link> help the user in selecting candidates for imaging. After selecting the desired candidates, the user can add them to the Ekos Scheduler list for evaluation. The user may also add the targets directly in Ekos scheduler or select a FITS file of a previous image.

            You must select the <guilabel>Target</guilabel> and <guilabel>Sequence</guilabel> before you can add a job to the Scheduler. When the scheduler starts, it evaluates all jobs in accord to the conditions and constraints specified and attempts to select the best job to execute. Selection of the job depends on a simple heuristic algorithm that scores each job given the conditions and constraints, each of which is weighted accordingly. If two targets have identical conditions and constraints, usually the higher priority target followed by higher altitude target is selected for execution. If no candidates are available at the current time, the scheduler goes into sleep mode and wakes up when the next job is ready for execution.

            Another critical feature of any remotely operated robotic observatory is weather monitoring. For weather updates, Ekos relies on the selected INDI weather driver to continuously monitor the weather conditions. For simplicity sake, the weather conditions can be summed in three states:

        <title>Startup &amp; Shutdown Scripts</title>
        <para>
            Due to the uniqueness of each observatory, Ekos enables the user to select startup and shutdown scripts. The scripts take care of any necessary procedures that must take place on startup and shutdown stages. On startup, Ekos executes the startup scripts and only proceeds to the remainder of the startup procedure (unpark dome/unpark mount) if the script completes successfully. Conversely, the shutdown procedure begins with parking the mount &amp; dome before executing the shutdown script as the final procedure.
        </para>
        <para>
            Startup and shutdown scripts can be written any language that can be executed on the local machine. It must return 0 to report success, any other exist value is considered an error indicator. The script's standard output is also directed to Ekos logger window. The following is an sample demo startup script in Python:
        </para>
        <programlisting language="python">
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import os
import time
import sys

print "Turning on observatory equipment..."
sys.stdout.flush()

time.sleep(5)

print "Checking safety switches..."
sys.stdout.flush()

time.sleep(5)

print "All systems are GO"
sys.stdout.flush()

exit(0)
        </programlisting>
        <para>
            The startup and shutdown scripts must be <emphasis>executable</emphasis> in order for Ekos to invoke them (&eg; use <userinput>chmod +x startup_script.py</userinput> to mark the script as executable). Ekos Scheduler enables truly simple robotic operation without the need of any human intervention in any step of the process. Without human presence, it becomes increasingly critical to gracefully recover from failures in any stage of the observation run. Using &plasma; notifications, the user can configure audible alarms and email notifications for the various events in the scheduler.

            Hubble-like super wide field images of <ulink url="http://billsnyderastrophotography.com/?page_id=3275">galaxies</ulink> and nebulae are truly awe-inspiring, and while it takes great skills to obtain such images and process them; many notable names in the field of astrophotography employ gear that is not <emphasis>vastly</emphasis> different from yours or mine. I emphasize <emphasis>vastly</emphasis> because some do indeed have impressive equipment and dedicated observatories worth tens of the thousands of dollars. Nevertheless, many amateurs can obtain stellar wide-field images by combining smaller images into a single grand mosaic.

        <para>
            We are often limited by our camera+telescope Field of View (FOV). By increasing FOV by means of a focal reducer or a shorter tube, we gain a larger sky coverage at the expense of spatial resolution. At the same time, many attractive wide-field targets span multiple FOVs across the sky. Without any changes to your astrophotography gear, it is possible to create a super mosaic image <emphasis>stitched</emphasis> together from several smaller images. There are two major steps to accomplish a super mosaic image:

            The 2nd step is handled by image processing applications such as <ulink url="https://pixinsight.com">PixInsight</ulink>, among others, and will not be the topic of discussion here. The first step can be accomplished in Ekos Scheduler where it creates a mosaic suitable for your equipment and in accordance with the desired field of view. Not only Ekos creates the mosaic panels for your target, but it also constructs the corresponding observatory jobs required to capture all the images. This greatly facilitates the logistics of capturing many images with different filters and calibration frames across a wide area of the sky.

            Before starting the <guilabel>Mosaic Job Creator</guilabel> in Ekos Scheduler, you need to select a target and a sequence file. The Sequence File contains all the information necessary to capture an image including exposure time, filters, temperature setting, &etc; Start the Mosaic Job Creator by clicking on the icon next to the <guibutton>Find</guibutton> button in Ekos Module.
        </para>
        <para>
            On first use, you need to enter your equipment settings including your telescope focal length in addition to camera's width, height, and pixel dimensions. Finally, you need to enter the rotation of the camera with respect to north or the position angle. If you don't know this value, start Ekos and slew to your desired target then use the <link linkend="ekos-align">Align module</link> to solve the image and obtain the position angle.
        </para>
        <para>
            Next, enter the desired number of horizontal and vertical panels (&eg; 2x2, 3x3, &etc;) and then click <guibutton>Update</guibutton>. The target FOV shall be calculated given the number of panels and your camera's FOV and the mosaic overlap shall be displayed. By default, the percentage of the overlap among images is 5%, but you can change this value to your desired value. You can also move the complete mosaic structure around to fine tune the position of the mosaic panels. When satisfied, click <guibutton>Create Jobs</guibutton> and Ekos shall create an observation job and a corresponding customized sequence file for each panel. All the jobs shall be saved to an Ekos Scheduler List (<filename role="extension">.esl</filename>) file that you can load on any suitable observing night and it will pick off where you left.
