                    You can define profiles for your equipment and their connection mode using the <guilabel>Profile Editor</guilabel>. Ekos comes pre-installed with the <guimenuitem>Simulators</guimenuitem> profile which can be used to start simulator devices for demonstration purposes:

                            <guilabel>Connection Mode</guilabel>: Ekos can be started either locally or remotely. Local mode is when Ekos is running in the same machine as INDI server, &ie; all the devices are connected directly to the machine. If you run INDI server on a remote machine (for example, on a Raspberry PI), you need to set the INDI server host and port.

                            <guilabel>Auto Connect</guilabel>: Check this option to enable automatic connection to all your devices after INDI server is started. If unchecked, INDI devices are created but not automatically connected. This is useful when you want to make changes to the driver (&eg; change baud rate or IP address or any other settings) <emphasis>before</emphasis> you connect to it.

                            <guilabel>Site Info</guilabel>: Optionally, you can check the <guilabel>Site Info</guilabel> checkbox and Ekos will load the <emphasis role="bold">current</emphasis> city and timezone whenever is Ekos is started with this profile. This can be useful when connecting to the remote geographic site so that Ekos is in sync location and time wise.

Please note that if you have a CCD with a guide head, you can leave the guider drop-down menu <emphasis>blank</emphasis> as Ekos will auto-detect the guide head from the CCD camera. Similarly, if your CCD includes embedded filter wheel support, then you do <emphasis>not</emphasis> need to specify the filter wheel device in the filter drop-down menu.
