<para>
&kstars; can control local and remote devices seamlessly via the 
<link linkend="what-is-indi">INDI</link> server/client architecture. INDI devices 
may be run in three different modes:
</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Local: The local mode is the most common and is used to control 
local device (&ie; a device attached to your machine).
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Server: The server mode establishes an INDI server for a particular 
device and waits for connections from remote clients. You cannot operate server devices, 
you can only start and shut them down.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Client: The client mode is used to connect to remote INDI servers 
running INDI devices. You can control remote devices seamlessly like local devices.
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>You can run local device, establish INDI servers, and connect to remote clients 
from the <guimenuitem>Device Manager</guimenuitem> in the 
<menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenuitem>Devices</guimenuitem></menuchoice> submenu.

<para>You can run devices by browsing the device tree, selecting a specific device, 
and then clicking on the <guibutton>Run Service</guibutton> button. You can select 
the operation mode, either local or server as defined above. The port number is 
randomly generated between the range from 7624 to 10,000. To specify a port, click 
on the port column next to the desired driver. &kstars; allows multiple drivers to 
run under one INDI server, and hence one port. Select multiple drivers then press 
<guibutton>Run Service</guibutton> button.

<para>Most telescopes are equipped with <hardware>RS232</hardware> interface
for remote control. Connect the RS232 jack in your telescope to your
computer's <hardware>Serial/USB</hardware> port. Traditionally, the RS232
connects to the serial port of your computer, but since many new laptops
abandoned the serial port in favor of <hardware>USB/FireWire</hardware>
ports, you might need to obtain a Serial to USB adaptor to use with new
laptops.
</para>

<para>After connecting your telescope to the Serial/USB port, turn your
telescope on. It is <emphasis>highly</emphasis> recommended that you
download and install the latest firmware for your telescope
controller.
</para>

<para>The telescope needs to be aligned before it can be used properly.
Align your telescope (one or two stars alignment) as illustrated in your
telescope manual.
</para>

<para>&kstars; needs to verify time and location settings before connecting 
to the telescope. This insures proper tracking and synchronization between 
the telescope and &kstars;. The following steps will enable you to connect 
to a device that is connected to your computer. To connect and control remote 
devices, please refer to 
<link linkend="indi-remote-control">remote device control</link> section.
</para>

<para>You can use the Telescope Setup Wizard and it will verify all the 
required information in the process. It can automatically scan ports for 
attached telescopes. You can run the wizard by selecting

<title>INDI Concepts</title>
<indexterm><primary>Telescope Control</primary>
<secondary>Concepts</secondary>
</indexterm>

<para>
The main key concept in INDI is that devices have the ability to describe themselves. 
This is accomplished by using XML to describe a generic hierarchy that can represent 
both canonical and non-canonical devices. In INDI, all <emphasis>devices</emphasis> 
may contain one or more <emphasis>properties</emphasis>. Any <emphasis>property</emphasis> 
may contain one or more <emphasis>elements</emphasis>. 
There are four types of INDI properties:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Text property.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Number property.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Switch property (Represented in GUI by buttons and checkboxes).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Light property (Represented in GUI by colored LEDs).</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>For example, all INDI devices share the CONNECTION standard switch <emphasis>property</emphasis>. 
The CONNECTION property has two elements: CONNECT and DISCONNECT switches. &kstars; parses the generic 
XML description of properties and builds a GUI representation suitable for direct human interaction.
</para>

<para>The INDI control panel offers many device properties not accessible from the sky map. 
The properties offered differ from one device to another. Nevertheless, all properties share 
common features that constrains how they are displayed and used:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Permission: All properties can either be read-only, write-only, or read and
write enabled. An example of a read-write property is the telescope's Right
Ascension. You can enter a new Right Ascension and the telescope, based on
current settings, will either slew or sync to the new input. Furthermore,
when the telescope slews, its Right Ascension gets updated and sent back to
the client.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>State: Prefixed to each property is a state indicator (round LED).
Each property has a state and an associated color code:
</para>
<table frame="top"><title>INDI State color code</title>
<tgroup cols="3" colsep="1" rowsep="1">
<thead>
<row>
<entry>State</entry>
<entry>Color</entry>
<entry>Description</entry>
</row>

<tbody>
<row>
<entry>Idle</entry>
<entry>Gray</entry>
<entry>Device is performing no action with respect to this property</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry>Ok</entry>
<entry>Green</entry>
<entry>Last operation performed on this property was successful and

<row>
<entry>Alert</entry>
<entry>Red</entry>
<entry>The property is in critical condition and needs immediate
attention</entry>
	</row>
	</tbody>
</tgroup>
</table>

<para>The device driver updates the property state in real-time when
necessary. For example, if the telescope is in the process of slewing to a
target, then the RA/DEC properties will be signaled as
<guilabel>Busy</guilabel>. When the slew process is completed successfully,
the properties will be signaled as <guilabel>Ok</guilabel>.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Context: Numerical properties can accept and process numbers in two formats:
decimal and sexagesimal. The sexagesimal format is convenient when expressing
time or equatorial/geographical coordinates. You can use any format at your
convenience. For example, all the following numbers are equal:
</para>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Time: The standard time for all INDI-related communications is Universal Time UTC 
specified as YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS in accord with ISO 8601. &kstars; communicates the 
correct UTC time with device drivers automatically. You can enable/disable automatic 
time updates from the <guimenuitem>INDI</guimenuitem> page in the settings dialog.

<title>Running an INDI server from the command line</title>
<para>While &kstars; allows you to easily deploy an INDI server; you can launch 
an INDI server from the command line.
</para>

<para>
Since INDI is an independent backend component, you can run an INDI server on a host 
without &kstars;. INDI can be compiled separately to run on remote hosts. 
Furthermore, device drivers log messages to <constant>stderr</constant> and that can 
be helpful in a debugging situation.  The syntax for INDI server is as following:
</para>

<para>$ <command>indiserver</command> [options] [<filename>driver</filename>
...]
</para>

<para>Options:</para>
<para> -l d    : log driver messages to d/YYYY-MM-DD.islog</para>
<para> -m m    : kill client if gets more than this many MB behind, default 10</para>
<para> -p p    : alternate IP port, default 7624</para>
<para> -f path : Path to fifo for dynamic startup and shutdown of drivers.</para>
<para> -v      : show key events, no traffic</para>
<para> -vv     : -v + key message content</para>
<para> -vvv    : -vv + complete xml</para>
<para> driver  : executable or device@host[:port]</para>

<para>For example, if you want to start an INDI server running an LX200 GPS

<qandaset defaultlabel="qanda">
<qandaentry>
<question id="what-is-indi">
<para>What is INDI?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para> <acronym>INDI</acronym> is the 
<ulink url="http://indi.sourceforge.net"> Instrument-Neutral-Distributed-Interface</ulink> control 
protocol developed by <author><firstname>Elwood</firstname><surname>C. Downey</surname></author> of 
<ulink url="http://www.clearskyinstitute.com/">ClearSky Institute</ulink>. &kstars; employs device 
drivers that are compatible with the INDI protocol. INDI has many advantages including loose coupling 
between hardware devices and software drivers. Clients that use the device drivers (like &kstars;) 
are completely unaware of the device capabilities. In run time, &kstars; communicates with the device 
drivers and builds a completely dynamical GUI based on services provided by the device. Therefore, new

</question>
<answer>
<para>
Yes. We plan to support major CCD cameras and focusers and extend support
for more telescopes. If you would like INDI to support a particular device,
please send an email to <email>indi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</email>

<question>
<para>
What operations does &kstars; provide to control the telescope?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
It depends on the particular telescope you're running, but the minimum three operations are 
<command>Slew</command>, <command>Track</command>, and <command>Sync</command>, which you can 
issue directly from the sky map. Your telescope must be aligned for those operations to perform 
correctly. Some telescopes offer you more operations like site management, slew modes, focusing, 
parking, and more. You can access the telescopes extended features from the INDI Control Panel 
in the <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenuitem>Devices</guimenuitem></menuchoice> submenu.

<question>
<para>
What's the difference between <command>Slew</command>, <command>Track</command>, and <command>Sync</command> exactly?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
The command <command>Slew</command> orders the telescope to move to a particular target, and once 
the telescope reaches its target, the telescope keeps tracking that target at a 
<emphasis>sidereal</emphasis> rate (i.e. the rate at which stars move across the sky). This works well 
for stars, Messier objects, and about everything outside our solar system. But solar system objects 
travel differently across the sky and so the telescope must <command>Track</command> the objects as they move.
</para>
<para>
Therefore, you need to issue a track command if you want to track an object with non-sidereal motion. 
On the other hand, <command>Sync</command> is used to synchronize the telescope's internal coordinates 
with that of an object you select.

<question>
<para>
Can I control my telescope remotely?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
Yes. You can start an INDI server on the machine connected to your telescope and the server will listen 
to requests from &kstars; clients. Once you're connected, you can control your telescope directly from 
the sky map. This procedure is described in detail in the 
<link linkend="indi-remote-control">Remote device control</link> section.

<para>
When I try to <guibutton>Connect</guibutton>, &kstars; reports that the
telescope is not connected to the serial/USB port. What can I do?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>This message is triggered when &kstars; cannot communicate with the telescope. Here are few things you can do:</para>

   <orderedlist>
   <listitem>
<para>Check that you have both reading and writing permission for the port you are trying to connect to.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
<para>Check the connection cable, make sure it is in good condition and test it with other applications.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
<para>Check your telescope power, make sure the power is on and that the telescope is getting enough power.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
<para>Set the correct port in the <guilabel>INDI Control Panel</guilabel>
under the <guimenu>Devices</guimenu> menu. The default device is
<constant>/dev/ttyS0</constant></para>
   </listitem>

<question>
<para>&kstars; reports that the telescope is online and ready, but I cannot find the telescope's crosshair, where is it?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>&kstars; retrieves the telescopes RA and DEC coordinates upon connection. If your 
alignment was performed correctly, then you should see the crosshair around your target 
in the Sky Map. However, the RA and DEC coordinates provided by the telescope may be 
incorrect (even below the horizon) and you need to <link linkend="indi-sync">Sync</link> 
your telescope to your current target. You can use the right-click menu to center and track 
the telescope crosshair in the sky map.
