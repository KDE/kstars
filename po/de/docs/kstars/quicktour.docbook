<para>
The above screenshot shows a typical view of the &kstars; program.  You
can see the sky display centered on Betelgeuse, the brightest star in
the constellation Orion. Stars are displayed with <link linkend="ai-colorandtemp">realistic
colors</link> and relative brightnesses.  In three corners
of the sky display, there are on-screen text labels displaying data on
the current time (<quote>LT: 3:08:30 AM EEST Wednesday, July 6, 2016</quote>), the current
Geographic Location (<quote>Bucharest, Romania</quote>), and the
current object in the center of the display (<quote>Focused on: Betelgeuse
(alpha Orionis)</quote>).  Above the sky display, there are two toolbars.
The main toolbar contains shortcuts for
<link linkend="kstars-menus">menu functions</link>, as well as a
time-step widget which controls how fast the simulation clock runs.
The view toolbar contains buttons that toggle the display of different
kinds of objects in the sky.  At the bottom of the window, there is a
status bar which displays the name of any object you click on, and the
<link linkend="ai-skycoords">sky coordinates</link> (both
Right Ascension/Declination and Azimuth/Altitude) of the mouse cursor.

<title>The Setup Wizard</title>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>Setup Wizard</primary></indexterm>
The first time you run &kstars;, you will be presented with a Setup Wizard,
which allows you to easily set your geographic location and download some
extra data files. You can press the <guilabel>OK</guilabel> button
at any time to exit the Setup Wizard.
</para>

<para>
The second page of the Setup Wizard allows you to choose the starting
geographic location, by selecting from the list of the 3400+ known
locations on the right side of the window.  The list of locations can be
filtered to match the text you enter in the <guilabel>City filter:</guilabel>,
<guilabel>Province filter:</guilabel>, and <guilabel>Country filter:</guilabel> edit
boxes.  If your desired location is not present in the list, you can
select a nearby city instead for now.  Later on, you can add your
precise location manually using the <link linkend="setgeo">Set Geographic
Location tool</link>.  Once you have selected a starting location, press
the <guilabel>Next</guilabel> button.
</para>

<para>
The last page of the Setup Wizard allows you to download extra data
that are not included with the standard distribution of &kstars;.
Simply press the <guilabel>Download Extra Data...</guilabel> button to open
the <guilabel>Get New Stuff</guilabel> tool.  When you are all done,
press the <guilabel>OK</guilabel> button in the Setup Wizard to
start exploring &kstars;.

<secondary>Basics</secondary></indexterm>
Now that we have the time and location set, let us have a look around.
You can pan the display using the arrow keys.  If you hold down the
&Shift; key before panning, the scrolling speed is increased.  The
display can also be panned by clicking and dragging with the mouse.
Note that while the display is scrolling, not all objects are
displayed.  This is done to cut down on the <acronym>CPU</acronym> load
of recomputing object positions, which makes the scrolling smoother
(you can configure what gets hidden while scrolling in the <link
linkend="config">Configure - &kstars;</link> window).

There are several ways to change the magnification (or
<firstterm>Zoom level</firstterm>) of the display:</para>

<para>
Zoom out until you can see a green curve; this represents your local
<link linkend="ai-horizon">horizon</link>.  If you have not adjusted
the default &kstars; configuration, the display will be solid green
below the horizon, representing the solid ground of the Earth.  There
is also a white curve, which represents the <link
linkend="ai-cequator">celestial equator</link>, and a brown curve, which
represents the <link linkend="ai-ecliptic">Ecliptic</link>, the path
that the Sun appears to follow across the sky over the course of a
year.  The Sun is always found somewhere along the Ecliptic, and the
planets are never far from it.
</para>

<para>
You can configure &kstars; to draw or not the celestial equator and Ecliptic curves
on the Sky Map using the <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Configure

&kstars; displays thousands of celestial objects: stars, planets,
comets, asteroids, clusters, nebulae and galaxies.  You can interact
with displayed objects to perform actions on them or obtain more
information about them.  Clicking on an object will identify it in the
status bar, and simply hovering the mouse cursor on an object will label
it temporarily in the map.  Double-clicking will recenter the display on
the object and begin tracking it (so that it will remain centered as
time passes).  <mousebutton>Right</mousebutton> clicking an object opens
the object's popup menu, which provides more options.

<para>
The appearance of the popup menu depends somewhat on the kind of
object you <mousebutton>right</mousebutton>-click on, but the basic
structure is listed below.  You can get
<link linkend="popup-menu">more detailed information about the popup
menu</link>.
</para>

<para>
The top section contains some lines of information which are not
selectable: the object's names ("Uranus"),
object type ("Solar system object"), and the constellation
which contains the object ("Pisces").  The next three lines show the
object's rise, set, and transit times.  If the rise and set times
say "circumpolar", it means that the object is always above the
horizon for the present location.
</para>
<para>
The middle section contains actions which can be performed on the
selected object, such as <guimenuitem>Center &amp; Track</guimenuitem>,
<guimenuitem>Details</guimenuitem>, and
<guimenuitem>Attach Label</guimenuitem>.  See the <link

and description of each action.
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>Objects in the Sky</primary>
<secondary>Internet Links</secondary>
<seealso>Popup Menu</seealso></indexterm>
The bottom section contains links to images and/or informative webpages
about the selected object.  If you know of an additional &URL; with
information or an image of the object, you can add a custom link to the
object's popup menu. Use the <guimenuitem>Details</guimenuitem> item in
the popup menu to open the <guilabel>Object Details</guilabel> dialog.
On the <guilabel>Links</guilabel> tab use the <guibutton>Add Link...</guibutton>
button.

<secondary>Finding by Name</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
You can search for named objects using the <guilabel>Find
Object</guilabel> tool, which can be opened by clicking on the
<guiicon>search</guiicon> icon in the toolbar, by selecting
<menuchoice><guimenu>Pointing</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Find
Object...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item, or by pressing
<keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>F</keycap></keycombo>.
The <guilabel>Find Object</guilabel> window is shown below:

  <textobject>
    <phrase>Find Object Window with search online feature</phrase>
  </textobject>
</mediaobject>
</screenshot>
</para>

<para>
The window contains a list of (almost, see <xref linkend="catalogs"/>)
all the named objects that &kstars; is aware of.  Many of the objects
only have a numeric catalog name (for example, NGC 3077), but some
objects have a common name as well (for example, Whirlpool Galaxy).
You can filter the list by name and by object type.  To filter by
name, enter a string in the edit box at the top of the window; the
list will then only contain names which start with that string.  To
filter by type, select a type from the combo box at the bottom of the
window.
</para>
<para>
&kstars; provides another method for resolving the objects that are
missing from any of its predefined catalogues, by using an internet
connection. Thus, if you want to find an object that &kstars; is not
aware of, you can easily do this by querying several professional
astronomical databases as: SIMBAD, NED or VizieR. This can be done by
entering the object's name and then press the <guibutton>or search the
internet for <replaceable>ObjectName</replaceable></guibutton> button. After your object is found,
you can use it exactly as any object that is already loaded into &kstars;
(&ie; adding it to the Observing WishList). If the object was not found
in the online databases, then a warning dialogue will pop-up. Once you
resolve an object by using this method, it is stored in &kstars; database,
so if you close &kstars; and open it again, your object will still be there.
</para>

<para>
You can choose to enable or disable this feature by checking or unchecking the
<guibutton>Resolve names not known to &kstars; using online services</guibutton>
check box from <guilabel>Catalogs</guilabel> page, inside of <guilabel>Configure
- &kstars;</guilabel> dialog (select the <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Configure &kstars;...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item).
If this checkbox is checked, when an object name unknown to &kstars;
is entered in the <guilabel>Find Dialog</guilabel>, &kstars; will contact online
services to learn about the desired object and then add it directly to &kstars;
database. The objects acquired in this manner are stored in a fake catalog, called
<quote>_Internet_Resolved</quote>. Thus, you can enable or disable the display of
these objects by checking or unchecking the <quote>_Internet_Resolved</quote> catalog
from the catalogues list. Note that you can not delete this fake catalogue, as you can
do with a custom catalogue. If this checkbox is unchecked, then the
<guilabel>Find Object</guilabel> window will be exactly the same, excepting a minor change:
the online searching button will no longer be visible.

To center the display on an object, highlight the desired object in
the list, and press <guibutton>Ok</guibutton>.  Note that if the
object is below the horizon, the program will warn you that you may
not see anything except the ground (you can make the ground invisible
in the <guilabel>Guides</guilabel> settings page, or by pressing the
<guiicon>Ground</guiicon> button in the View toolbar).

<para>
&kstars; will automatically begin tracking on an object whenever one
is centered in the display, either by using the <guilabel>Find
Object</guilabel> window, by double-clicking on it, or by
selecting <guimenuitem>Center &amp; Track</guimenuitem> from its
<mousebutton>right</mousebutton>-click popup menu.  You can disengage
tracking by panning the display, pressing the <guiicon>Stop Tracking</guiicon>
icon in the Main toolbar, or selecting <menuchoice><guimenu>Pointing</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Stop Tracking</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item.

When tracking on a Solar System body, &kstars; will automatically
attach an <quote>orbit trail</quote>, showing the path of the body
across the sky.  You will likely need to change the clock's timestep
to a large value (such as <quote>1 day</quote>) to see the trail.
