<para
>Precession is easiest to see by observing the <link linkend="ai-cpoles"
>Celestial Pole</link
>. To find the pole, first switch to Equatorial Coordinates in the <guilabel
>Configure &kstars;</guilabel
> window, and then hold down the <keycap
>Up arrow</keycap
> key until the display stops scrolling. The declination displayed in the centre of the <guilabel
>Info Panel</guilabel
> should be +90 degrees, and the bright star Polaris should be nearly at the centre of the screen. Try slewing with the left and right arrow keys. Notice that the sky appears to rotate around the Pole. </para

>We will now demonstrate Precession by changing the Date to a very remote year, and observing that the location of the Celestial Pole is no longer near Polaris. Open the <guilabel
>Set Time</guilabel
> window (<keycombo action="simul"
>&Ctrl;<keycap
>S</keycap
></keycombo
>), and set the date to the year 8000 (currently, &kstars; cannot handle dates much more remote than this, but this date is sufficient for our purposes). Notice that the sky display is now centred at a point between the constellations Cygnus and Cepheus. Verify that this is actually the pole by slewing left and right: the sky rotates about this point; in the year 8000, the North celestial pole will no longer be near Polaris. </para>
