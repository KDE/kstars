<para
>&kstars; can display light curves for variable stars from the observing program of the <ulink url="http://www.aavso.org"
>American Association of Variable Star Observers</ulink
> (<abbrev
>AAVSO</abbrev
>). This program monitors over 6,000 variable stars and consists of 10 million observations going back almost a century. &kstars; downloads the very latest data directly from the <abbrev
>AAVSO</abbrev
> database via the Internet, so a network connection is required to use this tool. </para>
<para
>To use the tool, select a variable star either by <firstterm
>designation</firstterm
> or name in the left panel, and set the start and end dates to be plotted. In the right panel, select the type of data that should be plotted (see below). When you have made you selections, press the <guibutton
>Retrieve Curve</guibutton
> button. &kstars; will automatically connect to the AAVSO server, which will generate the lightcurve plot and send it to your computer for display. A sample lightcurve plot is shown below: </para>

<para

<sect2 id="aavso-about">
<title
>About Variable Stars</title>
<para
><firstterm
>Variable stars</firstterm
> are stars that change in brightness. A <firstterm
>light curve</firstterm
> is a plot of a variable star's brightness over time. By looking at a light curve you can see how the star has behaved in the past and try to predict how it will behave in the future. Astronomers also use this data to model astrophysical processes in the star. This important to help us understand how stars work. </para>

<title
>The Data</title>

<para
>Here is a summary of the various types of data available in the light curves: <itemizedlist
>  
<listitem
><para
><firstterm
>Visual Observation</firstterm
>: This is an observation of a variable star by an observer with a regular telescope. It means that an observer saw the star at Y brightness on X date and time.</para
></listitem>

<listitem
><para
><firstterm
>Fainter than</firstterm
>: Sometimes the star is too faint to be seen by the observer. When that happens, the observer reports the faintest star seen in the field. These are called <quote
>fainter thans</quote
> because the variable star was fainter than the brightness reported.</para
></listitem>

<listitem
><para
><firstterm
>Average</firstterm
>: This is a computed running average of all the data reported. The <firstterm
>bin</firstterm
> number tells the computer how many days to use in each average calculation. This will need to be adjusted based on the frequency of observations. The error bars represent the 1 sigma standard deviation of error.</para
></listitem>

<listitem
><para
><firstterm
>CCDV</firstterm
>: These are observations reported using a <abbrev
>CCD</abbrev
> with a Johnson <abbrev
>V</abbrev
> filter. <abbrev
>CCDV</abbrev
> observations tend to be more accurate than visual (but not always).</para
></listitem>

<listitem

><firstterm

<listitem

<listitem

></listitem>

<listitem
><para
><firstterm
>Discrepant Data</firstterm
>: This is data that has been flagged by an <abbrev
>AAVSO</abbrev
> staff member as being discrepant following <abbrev
>HQ</abbrev
> rules for data validation. Contact <email
>aavso@aavso.org</email
> for more information.</para
></listitem>

<listitem
><para
><firstterm
>Dates</firstterm
>: The observational database the light curves are based on is updated every 10 minutes so you can get data in near real-time. Right now light curve data is only available back to 1961, but this will likely be expanded further back in time in the future.</para
