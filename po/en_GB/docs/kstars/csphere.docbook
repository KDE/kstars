<para

>Of course, we know that the objects in the sky are not on the surface of a sphere centred on the Earth, so why bother with such a construct? Everything we see in the sky is so very far away, that their distances are impossible to gauge just by looking at them. Since their distances are indeterminate, you only need to know the <emphasis

> toward the object to locate it in the sky. In this sense, the celestial sphere model is a very practical model for mapping the sky. </para
