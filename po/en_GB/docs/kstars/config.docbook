<para
>There is a list of over 2500 predefined cities available to choose from. You set your location by highlighting a city from this list. Each city is represented in the world map as a small dot, and when a city is highlighted in the list, a red crosshairs appears on its location in the map. </para>

>Filtering</secondary
></indexterm>
It is not practical to scroll through the full list of 2500 locations, looking for a specific city. To make searches easier, the list can be filtered by entering text in the boxes below the map. For example, in the screenshot, the text <quote
>Ba</quote
> appears in the <guilabel
>City Filter</guilabel
> box, while <quote
>M</quote
> has been entered in the <guilabel
>Province Filter</guilabel
> box, and <quote
>USA</quote
> is in the <guilabel
>Country Filter</guilabel
> box. Note that all of the cities displayed in the list have city, province and country names that begin with the entered filter strings, and that the message below the filter boxes indicates that 7 cities are matched by the filters. Also notice that the dots representing these seven cities in the map have been coloured white, while the unmatched cities remain grey. </para
><para
>The list can also be filtered by location in the map. Clicking anywhere in the world map will show only those cities within two degrees of the clicked location. At this time, you can search by name, or by location, but not both at once. In other words, when you click on the map, the name filters are ignored, and vice versa. </para

The <link linkend="ai-geocoords"

>Add to List</guibutton

>Clear Fields</guibutton
> button, and entering the data for the new location. Note that all fields except the optional <guilabel
>State/Province</guilabel
> must be filled before the new location can be added to the list. &kstars; will automatically load your custom locations for all future sessions. Please note, at this point, the only way to remove a custom location is to remove the appropriate line from the file <filename

When &kstars; starts up, the time is set to your computer's system clock, and the &kstars; clock is running to keep up with the real time. If you want to stop the clock, select <guimenuitem
>Stop Clock</guimenuitem
> from the <guimenu
>Time</guimenu
> menu, or simply click on the <guiicon
>Pause</guiicon
> icon in the toolbar. You can make the clock run slower or faster than normal, or even make it run backward, using the time-step spinbox in the toolbar. This spinbox has two sets of up/down buttons. The first one will step through all 83 available time steps, one by one. The second one will skip to the next higher (or lower) unit of time, which allows you to make large timestep changes more quickly. </para>

You can set the time and date by selecting <guimenuitem

>Time</guimenu

>time</guiicon
> icon in the toolbar. The <guilabel
>Set Time</guilabel

&kstars; can accept very remote dates beyond the usual limits imposed by QDate. Currently, you can set the date between the years -50000 and +50000. We may extend this range even further in future releases. However, please be aware that the accuracy of the simulation becomes more and more degraded as more remote dates are examined. This is especially true for the positions of solar system bodies. </para

The <guilabel

<para
>The left panel shows a list of all display items with adjustable colours. Click on any item to bring up a colour selection window to adjust its colour. Below the list is the <guilabel
>Star Colour Mode</guilabel
> selection box. By default, &kstars; draws stars with a <link linkend="ai-colorandtemp"
>realistic colour</link
> tint according to the spectral type of the star. However, you may also choose to draw the stars as solid white, black or red circles. If you are using the realistic star colours, you can set the saturation level of the star colours with the <guilabel
>Star Colour Intensity</guilabel
> spinbox. </para>
<para
>The right panel lists the defined colour schemes. There are four predefined schemes: the <guilabel
>Default</guilabel
> scheme, <guilabel
>Star Chart</guilabel
>, which uses black stars on a white background, <guilabel
>Night Vision</guilabel
>, which uses only shades of red in order to protect dark-adapted vision, and <guilabel
>Moonless Night</guilabel
>, a more realistic, dark theme. Additionally, you can save the current colour settings as a custom scheme by clicking the <guibutton
>Save Current Colors</guibutton
> button. It will prompt you for a name for the new scheme, and then your scheme will appear in the list in all future &kstars; sessions. To remove a custom scheme, simply highlight it in the list, and press the <guibutton

<indexterm
><primary
>Atmospheric Refraction</primary
></indexterm
> The <guilabel
>Correct for atmospheric refraction</guilabel
> checkbox controls whether the positions of objects are corrected for the effects of the atmosphere. Because the atmosphere is a spherical shell, light from outer space is <quote
>bent</quote
> as it passes through the atmosphere to our telescopes or eyes on the Earth's surface. The effect is largest for objects near the horizon, and actually changes the predicted rise or set times of objects by a few minutes. In fact, when you <quote
>see</quote
> a sunset, the Sun's actual position is already well below the horizon; atmospheric refraction makes it seem as if the Sun is still in the sky. Note that atmospheric refraction is never applied if you are using <guilabel
>Equatorial coordinates</guilabel
>. </para
><para>
<indexterm
><primary
>Animated Slewing</primary
></indexterm
> The <guilabel
>Use animating slewing</guilabel
> checkbox controls how the display changes when a new focus position is selected in the map. By default, you will see the sky drift or <quote
>slew</quote
> to the new position; if you untick this option, then the display will instead <quote
>snap</quote
> immediately to the new focus position. </para

If the <guilabel
>Attach label to centred object</guilabel
> checkbox is selected, then a name label will automatically be attached to an object when it is being tracked by the program. The label will be removed when the object is no longer being tracked. Note that you can also manually attach a persistent name label to any object with its <link linkend="popup-menu"
>popup menu</link
>. </para

<indexterm

>Objects in the Sky</primary>
<secondary

></indexterm>
There are three situations when &kstars; must redraw the sky display very rapidly: when a new focus position is selected (and <guilabel
>Use animated slewing</guilabel
> is checked), when the sky is dragged with the mouse, and when the time step is large. In these situations, the positions of all objects must be recomputed as rapidly as possible, which can put a large load on the <abbrev
>CPU</abbrev
>. If the <abbrev
>CPU</abbrev
> cannot keep up with the demand, then the display will seem sluggish or jerky. To mitigate this, &kstars; will hide certain objects during these rapid-redraw situations, as long as the <guilabel
>Hide objects while moving</guilabel
> checkbox is selected. The timestep threshold above which objects will be hidden is determined by the <guilabel
>Also hide if timescale greater than:</guilabel
> timestep-spinbox. You can specify the objects that should be hidden in the <guilabel
>Configure Hidden Objects</guilabel
> group box. </para>
