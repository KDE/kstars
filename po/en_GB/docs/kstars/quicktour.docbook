<para
>The above screenshot shows a typical view of the KStars program. You can see the sky display centered on Betelgeuse, the brightest star in the constellation Orion. Orion has just risen above the eastern horizon. Stars are displayed with <link linkend="ai-colorandtemp"
>realistic colors</link
> and relative brightnesses. M 42, the Orion Nebula, is visible on the right side of the screen, just above the horizon. If you look closely, you can also see the Sun and the planet Mercury in the upper left. In three corners of the sky display, there are on-screen text labels displaying data on the current time (<quote
>LT: 06:44:58 20 June 2004</quote
>), the current Geographic Location (<quote
>Tucson, Arizona, USA</quote
>), and the current object in the center of the display (<quote
>Focused on: Betelgeuse (alpha Orionis)</quote
>). Above the sky display, there are two toolbars. The main toolbar contains shortcuts for <link linkend="kstars-menus"
>menu functions</link
>, as well as a time-step widget which controls how fast the simulation clock runs. The view toolbar contains buttons that toggle the display of different kinds of objects in the sky. At the bottom of the window, there is a status bar which displays the name of any object you click on, and the <link linkend="ai-skycoords"
>sky coordinates</link
> (both Right Ascension/Declination and Azimuth/Altitude) of the mouse cursor. </para>

<para
>The first page of the Setup Wizard allows you to choose the starting geographic location, by selecting from the list of the 2500+ known locations on the right side of the window. The list of locations can be filtered to match the text you enter in the <guilabel
>City</guilabel
>, <guilabel
>Province</guilabel
>, and <guilabel
>Country</guilabel
> edit boxes. If your desired location is not present in the list, you can select a nearby city instead for now. Later on, you can add your precise location manually using the <link linkend="setgeo"
>Set Geographic Location tool</link
>. Once you have selected a starting location, press the <guilabel
>Next</guilabel
> button. </para>

<para
>The second page of the Setup Wizard allows you to download extra data that are not included with the standard distribution of &kstars;. Simply press the <guilabel
>Download Extra Data</guilabel

Now that we have the time and location set, let us have a look around. You can pan the display using the arrow keys. If you hold down the &Shift; key before panning, the scrolling speed is doubled. The display can also be panned by clicking and dragging with the mouse. Note that while the display is scrolling, not all objects are displayed. This is done to cut down on the <acronym
>CPU</acronym
> load of recomputing object positions, which makes the scrolling smoother (you can configure what gets hidden while scrolling in the <link linkend="config"
>Configure &kstars;</link
> window). There are seven ways to change the magnification (or <firstterm
>Zoom level</firstterm
>) of the display:</para>

&kstars; displays thousands of celestial objects: stars, planets, comets, asteroids, clusters, nebulae and galaxies. You can interact with displayed objects to perform actions on them or obtain more information about them. Clicking on an object will identify it in the status bar, and simply hovering the mouse cursor on an object will label it temporarily in the map. Double-clicking will re-centre the display on the object and begin tracking it (so that it will remain centred as time passes). <mousebutton
>Right</mousebutton
> clicking an object opens the object's popup menu, which provides more options. </para>

<para

<para

The next three labels show the object's rise, transit and set times. If the rise and set times say "circumpolar", it means that the object is always above the horizon for the present location. </para>
<para

>Center and Track</guimenuitem

>Angular Distance To...</guimenuitem
> (which enters the Angular Distance Mode, allowing you to measure the angle between objects in the sky), <guimenuitem

<para
>The window contains a list of all the named objects that &kstars; is aware of. Many of the objects only have a numeric catalogue name (for example, NGC 3077), but some objects have a common name as well (for example, Whirlpool Galaxy). You can filter the list by name and by object type. To filter by name, enter a string in the edit box at the top of the window; the list will then only contain names which start with that string. To filter by type, select a type from the combo box at the bottom of the window. </para
><para
>To centre the display on an object, highlight the desired object in the list, and press <guibutton
>Ok</guibutton
>. Note that if the object is below the horizon, the program will warn you that you may not see anything except the ground (you can make the ground invisible in the <guilabel

>Ground</guiicon

&kstars; will automatically begin tracking on an object whenever one is centred in the display, either by using the <guilabel
>Find Object</guilabel
> window, by double-clicking on it, or by selecting <guimenuitem
>Center and Track</guimenuitem
> from its <mousebutton
>right</mousebutton
>-click popup menu. You can disengage tracking by panning the display, pressing the <guiicon
>Lock</guiicon

<secondary

</indexterm>
When tracking on a Solar System body, &kstars; will automatically attach an <quote
>orbit trail</quote
>, showing the path of the body across the sky. You will likely need to change the clock's timestep to a large value (such as <quote
>1 day</quote
>) to see the trail. </para>

<para
>This concludes the tour of &kstars;, although we have only scratched the surface of the available features. &kstars; includes many useful <link linkend="tools"
>astronomy tools</link

>, and it offers a wide variety of <link linkend="config"
>configuration and customization</link
> options. In addition, this Handbook includes the <link linkend="astroinfo"
>AstroInfo Project</link
>, a series of short, interlinked articles explaining some of the celestial and astrophysical concepts behind &kstars;. </para>
