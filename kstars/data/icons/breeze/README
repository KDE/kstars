Note:  This theme folder should not be needed, but is apparently required to make the themes work on Macs 
It was added because we want to load the themes from /Contents/Resources on Macs.
For some reason, they were not loading unless there was a valid theme folder with a valid index.theme and at least one icon in the correct place in the qrc.
