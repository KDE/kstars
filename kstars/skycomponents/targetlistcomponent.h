/**
 *@class TargetListComponent
 *@short Highlights objects present in certain lists by drawing "target" symbols around them.
 *
 * To represent lists of specific objects on the skymap (eg: A star
 * hopping route, or a list of planned observation targets), one would
 * typically like to draw over the skymap, a bunch of symbols
 * highlighting the locations of these objects. This class manages
 * drawing of such lists. Along with the list, we also associate a pen
 * to use to represent objects from that list. Once this class is made
 * aware of a list to plot (which is stored somewhere else), it does
 * so when called from the SkyMapComposite. The class may be supplied
 * with pointers to two methods that tell it whether to draw symbols /
 * labels or not. Disabling symbol drawing is equivalent to disabling
 * the list. If the pointers are nullptr, the symbols are always drawn,
 * but the labels are not drawn.
 *
 *@note This does not inherit from ListComponent because it is not
 * necessary. ListComponent has extra methods like objectNearest(),
 * which we don't want. Also, ListComponent maintains its own list,
 * whereas this class merely holds a pointer to a list that's
 * manipulated from elsewhere.
